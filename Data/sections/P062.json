  "introduction": "Equivariance, a crucial property where a model\u2019s output transforms predictably with input transfor-\nmations, is vital for numerous applications, especially in domains exhibiting inherent symmetries\nlike image processing and physics simulations. Large pretrained models, while powerful, often\nlose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This loss\ncan significantly impact performance and generalization. The inherent symmetries present in many\ndatasets are often exploited implicitly or explicitly by the model architecture. For example, con-\nvolutional neural networks implicitly leverage translation equivariance, while other architectures\nare designed to explicitly incorporate other symmetries. However, standard fine-tuning or transfer\nlearning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performance\nand robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where the\ncomputational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead to\nunpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differs\nsignificantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development of\nnovel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance.\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving\ntheir inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniques\nto maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the need\nto optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the model\u2019s equivariant\nproperties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-\nspecific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior.\nThe regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations\nand model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems and\nmodels. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived from\nthe theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization.\n\nThe proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, showcasing\nsignificant performance improvements over existing adaptation techniques. We demonstrate that\nour approach effectively preserves equivariance while achieving state-of-the-art results on several\n\n.\n\n\fchallenging tasks. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both\nperformance and equivariance provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for various\nscenarios. The results highlight the critical importance of preserving equivariance during model\nadaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings suggest that\nincorporating equivariance constraints during adaptation is a promising avenue for enhancing the\nrobustness and generalization capabilities of large pretrained models.\n\nOur work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks ??, extending its scope to\nthe complex problem of model adaptation. We provide a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained\nmodels while retaining their desirable properties. The ability to maintain equivariance during\nadaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry\nis paramount. Future research will focus on extending our method to more intricate scenarios and\nexploring its applications in diverse domains. We believe that our approach represents a significant\nstep towards developing more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models.\n\nFinally, we acknowledge the limitations of our approach and propose avenues for future research.\nWhile our method demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving equivariance, challenges\nremain. For instance, enforcing equivariance constraints can be computationally expensive, especially\nfor large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient\nalgorithms to mitigate this computational burden. Furthermore, we plan to explore the application of\nour method to a broader range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness.\nThe potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of our method is a key focus for future\nresearch.",
  "related_work": "The adaptation of large pretrained models has been a significant area of research, with various\ntechniques proposed to improve performance on downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, transfer learning,\nand other adaptation strategies have shown remarkable success in many applications. However,\nthese methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance properties\nof the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating\nequivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches that\nprimarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss of\nequivariance. The preservation of equivariance is particularly important in domains where symmetries\nplay a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. Existing methods\noften fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced\ngeneralization capabilities.\n\nEarly work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor-\nporate symmetries into their structure. Groups such as the rotation group SO(2) and the translation\ngroup have been extensively studied, leading to the development of specialized layers and architec-\ntures that exhibit desired equivariance properties. These architectures, while effective in specific\nscenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Our\napproach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures and\ntransformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibility\nis crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specialized\narchitectures.\n\nRecent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance in\nneural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function that\npenalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches are\ncomputationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our method\noffers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term that\ncan be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulation\nof this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions\nand carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains its\nequivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task.\n\nFurthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biases\ninto neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain,\nhave been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural\n\n2\n\n\fnetworks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performance\nof models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporate\nthis inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from the\nprior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. This\ncombination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution of\nour work.\n\nIn summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservation\nof equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel method\nthat combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintain\nequivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained models\nwhile preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalization\ncapabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and provides\na valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintain\nequivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications\nwhere symmetry is paramount.",
  "methodology": "This section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our\napproach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the model\u2019s inherent equivariance\nproperties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific loss\nfunction with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. This\nensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performance\non the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable to\ndifferent types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. We\nachieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformation\ngroups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries,\nfrom simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of the\nregularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring a\nprincipled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over-\nregularization, ensuring that the model\u2019s performance on the target task is not unduly compromised.\nThe hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross-\nvalidation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance.\n\nThe adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariant\nmodel. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g.,\ncross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance-\npreserving regularization term. The task-specific loss encourages the model to perform well on the\nnew task, while the regularization term ensures that the model\u2019s output transforms predictably under\nthe relevant transformations. The specific form of the regularization term depends on the type of\nequivariance being preserved and the model architecture. For instance, for translation equivariance,\nthe regularization term might penalize differences in the model\u2019s output when the input is translated.\nFor rotational equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the model\u2019s output\nwhen the input is rotated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method,\nand we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material.\nThe entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as\nstochastic gradient descent or Adam.\n\nA key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. These\nhyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered,\nand other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy,\nusing techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configuration\nfor each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics,\nsuch as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and\nR-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of\nequivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assess\nhow well the model\u2019s output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties under\nvarious transformations. This allows us to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our regularization\ntechnique in preserving equivariance during the adaptation process.\n\n3\n\n\fThe computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, especially for large\nmodels and complex transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies,\nincluding efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware\naccelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computational\nburden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. These\nstrategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models and\ntasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explore\nthe trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providing\ninsights into the optimal balance for different scenarios.\n\nIn summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting large\npretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefully\ndesigned regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimization\ntechniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approach\nopens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetry\nplays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility and\nscalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way for\nmore robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future.",

  "results": "This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariant\nadaptation of large pretrained models. We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets,\ncomparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques.

  "introduction": "To address the challenges of temporal asynchrony and limited communication bandwidth in vehicle-\ninfrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection, this paper introduces Feature Flow Net\n(FFNet), a novel framework that transmits compressed feature flow rather than raw data or feature\nmaps. This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle\ntemporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporal\ncoherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety of\nfeature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes between\nconsecutive frames, termed \"feature flow.\" This representation efficiently captures the motion and\nevolution of objects within the scene. By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantly\nreduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. The efficiency\ngains are particularly crucial in resource-constrained environments typical of vehicle-to-infrastructure\ncommunication. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for\nreliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels.\n\nThe design of FFNet incorporates several key modules. Firstly, a feature extraction module processes\ninput frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flow\nestimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flow\nfield is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the current\nframe\u2019s features. The difference between these warped features and the current frame\u2019s features\nconstitutes the feature flow. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme,\ncarefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. The\nselection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between data\nreduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection.\n\nThe compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where it\u2019s used to\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as input\nfor the object detection process. The utilization of feature flow enables efficient updates, even\nin the presence of temporal misalignment between frames received from disparate sources. This\nresilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. The\nproposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial\n\n.\n\n\fimprovements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods\nthat transmit raw data or full feature maps ??.\n\nFurther validation of FFNet\u2019s robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper-\niments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Results\nconsistently show that FFNet maintains high detection accuracy even under significant temporal\nmisalignment, surpassing existing methods reliant on strict synchronization ?. This robustness stems\nfrom the ability of feature flow to capture the essential scene changes, irrespective of minor temporal\ndiscrepancies. A detailed analysis of the compression scheme\u2019s efficiency reveals a substantial\nreduction in bandwidth consumption compared to transmitting raw data or full feature maps.\n\nFinally, the influence of different compression parameters on detection performance and communica-\ntion efficiency is thoroughly investigated. The findings offer insights into the optimal balance between\ncompression ratio and detection accuracy, enabling adaptive adjustment of compression parameters\nbased on available bandwidth and desired detection performance. The FFNet framework presents a\npromising solution for efficient and robust VIC3D object detection in challenging communication\nenvironments. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such as\nocclusions and varying weather conditions ?.",
  "related_work": "The problem of efficient data transmission in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for 3D\nobject detection has received considerable attention. Early approaches focused on transmitting raw\nsensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?.\nHowever, this approach suffers from high bandwidth requirements and is susceptible to delays and\npacket loss, particularly in challenging communication environments. Subsequent work explored the\nuse of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methods\noften introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance.\nFurthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them less\nrobust to temporal asynchrony.\n\nMore recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission.\nThese methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmitting\nthese features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of data\ntransmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially for\nhigh-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge.\nSeveral works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods to\ntemporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However,\nthese methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios with\nsignificant delays or jitter.\n\nOur work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in features\nbetween consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on the\nconcept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object tracking\nor video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNet\noperates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing for\na more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compact\nrepresentation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings.\n\nThe use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com-\npression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compression\nscheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balance\nbetween compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance.\nFurthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of the\ncompression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. This\nadaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability can\nfluctuate significantly.\n\nFinally, the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage over existing methods.\nWhile some previous works have addressed temporal asynchrony in V2I communication, they of-\n\n2\n\n\ften rely on complex synchronization mechanisms or introduce significant computational overhead.\nFFNet\u2019s ability to handle temporal misalignment effectively without requiring strict synchroniza-\ntion makes it particularly well-suited for real-world V2I applications where delays and jitter are\nunavoidable. The proposed method offers a significant improvement in both efficiency and robustness\ncompared to existing approaches.",
  "methodology": "The proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchrony\nand limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans-\nmitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages the\ntemporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutive\nframes rather than transmitting redundant information. The core of FFNet consists of three main\nmodules: feature extraction, flow estimation, and compression.\n\nThe feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as\nResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. These\nfeature maps capture rich semantic information about the scene, providing a robust representation\nfor subsequent processing. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computational\ncomplexity and feature representation quality. We experimented with several architectures and\nselected the one that provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The\noutput of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream.\n\nThe flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This is\nachieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net.\nThe optical flow field represents the motion of features between frames, providing a measure of how\nfeatures move and change over time. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from the\nprevious frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accurately\nrepresenting the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. The\naccuracy of the optical flow estimation is critical for the overall performance of FFNet.\n\nThe difference between the warped features from the previous frame and the current frame\u2019s features\nconstitutes the feature flow. This feature flow represents the dynamic changes in the scene, capturing\nthe motion and evolution of objects. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compression\nscheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. This\ncompression scheme is crucial for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. We\nexplored various compression techniques, including autoencoders and learned quantization methods,\nand selected the one that provided the best balance between compression ratio and reconstruction\naccuracy. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit.\n\nAt the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used to\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for object\ndetection using a suitable object detection network. The use of feature flow allows for efficient\nupdates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames. The robustness of FFNet\nto temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and\njitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction to\nobject detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution for\nresource-constrained environments. The performance of FFNet is evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D\ndataset, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency\ncompared to baseline methods ????.",
  "experiments": "To evaluate the performance of FFNet, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale VIC3D\ndataset.

The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets,\nwith a ratio of 70:15:15. We used standard metrics for evaluating object detection performance,\nincluding precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

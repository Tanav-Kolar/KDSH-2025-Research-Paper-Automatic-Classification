  "introduction": "The objective of this research is to address the phenomenon of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) agents [1, 2], where neural networks lose their ability to learn effectively over time.\nThis persistent challenge significantly hinders the long-term performance and adaptability of RL\nagents in dynamic environments. Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or\nhyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our\nwork introduces a novel intervention, termed \"plasticity injection,\" designed to directly tackle the\nroot causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared\nto existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive\nhyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability\nto proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational\ndemands.\n\nPlasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for\nidentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability\nallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing\ncatastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The\ndiagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,\nproviding early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with\nreactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already\noccurred.\n\nSecond, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of\ntrainable parameters or alterations to the network\u2019s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the\ncomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This\nis achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network\u2019s internal\ndynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting\nthe agent\u2019s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss.\nThe preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent\u2019s performance in its\noperational environment.\n\nThird, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved\ncomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary\nresource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is\ntriggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to\n\n.\n\n\faddress emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate\nfixed resources regardless of the agent\u2019s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The\ndynamic nature of plasticity injection contributes to its overall efficiency and scalability.\n\nThe effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,\nincluding continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a\nconsistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL\nalgorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research\nwill explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex\nreal-world scenarios.",
  "related_work": "The problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensively\nstudied across various machine learning domains [1, 2]. In the context of deep reinforcement learning\n(RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agent\u2019s ability to learn new tasks or adapt\nto changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditional\napproaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate\nnetworks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to\npreserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,\nparticularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in\ncomplex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing\nplasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs\nsignificantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention\nthat minimizes computational overhead.\n\nSeveral studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and\nadaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing\nneurons or layers based on the agent\u2019s performance or the complexity of the environment. However,\nthese methods typically focus on optimizing the network\u2019s overall structure rather than directly\naddressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method\nselectively modifies the network\u2019s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing\nfor a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids\nthe potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes.\nThe dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring\nthat resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods\nthat may allocate resources inefficiently.\n\nAnother line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training through\ntechniques such as curriculum learning [8] and meta-learning [9]. Curriculum learning gradually\nintroduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of\nknowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that\ncan quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly\ncontribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent\u2019s overall learning stability, they do not\ndirectly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements\nthese methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity\nloss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of our\nframework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which can\ninform the development of even more effective training strategies.\n\nThe concept of \"plasticity\" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience [10, 11], where it refers\nto the brain\u2019s ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience.\nOur work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain\u2019s ability\nto dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,\nunlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable\nmethods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design\nof our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and\narchitectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents\nacross a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection\n\n2\n\n\fwith other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand\nits applicability and impact.",
  "methodology": "The core of our approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" revolves around three interconnected compo-\nnents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism.\nThese components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity\nloss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during\ntraining, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully\nselected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance\ndegradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss\nfunction fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the\nnetwork\u2019s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of\nactivations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the\nnetwork\u2019s internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and\ntheoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity\nscore, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a\ntrigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms.\n\nOur mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network\u2019s internal dynamics rather than\nits overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential\ndisruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a\ncarefully designed set of operations applied to the network\u2019s weight matrices and biases. These\noperations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score\nindicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network\u2019s\nability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore\nseveral different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and\ntargeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are\ndetermined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The\neffectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of\nagents with and without plasticity injection.\n\nThe dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively\nexpanding the network\u2019s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity\nscore, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity\nloss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with\nthe specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected\nplasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specific\nlayer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated\nefficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The\nadded capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption\nto the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing\nthe computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism.\n\nThe entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easily\nintegrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility and\nadaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally\nefficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The\ncomputational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures\nused in each component. The framework\u2019s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL\nbenchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The results\ndemonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.\n\nOur experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing\nboth continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We\ncompare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art\nbaselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The\nevaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency.\n\n3\n\n\fWe analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection\nframework and to identify potential areas for future improvement. The detailed experimental results\nand analysis are presented in the Results section.",

The experimental setup is designed to isolate the effects of plasticity\ninjection, ensuring that any observed performance improvements can be directly attributed to our\nproposed method. We meticulously control for confounding factors, such as hyperparameter settings\nand training procedures, to maintain the integrity of the experimental results.\n\nThe evaluation metrics employed in our experiments include long-term performance, learning stability,\nand computational efficiency. Long-term performance is measured by the average cumulative reward\nobtained by the agent over an extended training period. Learning stability is assessed by analyzing\nthe variance in the agent\u2019s performance over time, with lower variance indicating greater stability.\nComputational efficiency is evaluated by measuring the training time and resource consumption\nof the agents. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the overall effectiveness of\nplasticity injection. We utilize statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to determine the statistical\nsignificance of the observed performance differences between the agents with and without plasticity\ninjection. The significance level is set at \u03b1 = 0.05 for all statistical tests. The detailed results of these\nstatistical analyses are presented in the following subsections.\n\nTo further analyze the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection framework, we\nconduct ablation studies. These studies involve systematically removing individual components of\nthe framework and evaluating the resulting performance.

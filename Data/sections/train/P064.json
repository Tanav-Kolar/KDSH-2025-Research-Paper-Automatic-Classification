  "introduction": "The goal of this paper is to empower open-source large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA,\nVicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for tasks involving visual comprehension\nand image generation. This is a significant challenge, as current open-source LLMs often lack the\nsophisticated capabilities of their proprietary counterparts, such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling\ncomplex interactions with external tools. Our approach focuses on bridging this gap by leveraging\na novel self-instruction framework. This framework allows these open-source models to learn to\nutilize a diverse range of tools, both seen and unseen, in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, thereby\nsignificantly expanding their functional capabilities. The key innovation lies in our ability to teach\nthe models to understand and interpret tool descriptions, enabling seamless integration with new tools\nwithout requiring extensive retraining. This is achieved through a carefully designed combination of\nprompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, which we detail in subsequent sections.\nThe resulting system demonstrates a remarkable ability to generalize to unseen tools and tasks,\nshowcasing the robustness and adaptability of our approach.\n\nOur self-instruction framework addresses a critical need in the field of large language models: the\ndevelopment of accessible and adaptable models capable of interacting with the real world through\ndiverse modalities. Existing methods often rely on extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures,\nlimiting their applicability and scalability. In contrast, our approach emphasizes simplicity and\nefficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source LLMs and tools. The modular design of\nour framework allows for easy integration of new tools and tasks, fostering a continuous improvement\ncycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model training, and performance evaluation. This\niterative process ensures that the model\u2019s capabilities are constantly refined and expanded, leading to\na more robust and versatile system.\n\nThe core of our method involves generating a diverse and representative dataset of instructions and\ncorresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to cover a wide range\nof scenarios and complexities, ensuring that the model is exposed to a rich and varied learning\nexperience. The use of reinforcement learning further enhances the model\u2019s ability to learn optimal\n\n.\n\n\ftool usage strategies, going beyond simple imitation learning to develop a deeper understanding of\nthe task and the tools available. This allows the model to not only execute tasks correctly but also\nto select the most appropriate tools for a given situation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking\nnot typically observed in simpler approaches. The resulting system exhibits a remarkable capacity\nto adapt its tool usage strategies based on the specific requirements of the task, highlighting the\neffectiveness of our self-instruction framework.\n\nThrough extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance across\nvarious visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image generation.\nOur results show that the model is able to generalize effectively to unseen tools, achieving performance\ncomparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary LLMs on similar tasks.

  "related_work": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools has emerged as a significant\narea of research [1, 2]. Early work focused primarily on integrating LLMs with specific tools,\noften requiring significant engineering effort for each new tool [3]. These approaches lacked the\ngenerality and adaptability needed for seamless integration with a diverse range of tools. Our work\nbuilds upon these efforts by proposing a self-instruction framework that enables LLMs to learn to\nutilize tools in a more generalizable manner. This contrasts with previous methods that often relied\non extensive fine-tuning or complex architectures, limiting their scalability and applicability. Our\napproach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for a wide range of open-source\nLLMs and tools. The modular design of our framework allows for easy integration of new tools and\ntasks, fostering a continuous improvement cycle driven by iterative instruction generation, model\ntraining, and performance evaluation.\n\nSeveral recent studies have explored the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for tool use in LLMs [4,\n5]. These methods typically involve training an RL agent to select and utilize tools based on a reward\nsignal. However, these approaches often require significant amounts of labeled data or carefully\ndesigned reward functions, which can be challenging to obtain. Our self-instruction framework\naddresses these limitations by leveraging a combination of prompt engineering and RL, allowing the\nmodel to learn from a diverse set of instructions and tool usage examples without requiring extensive\nlabeled data. The iterative nature of our framework allows for continuous improvement, leading\nto more robust and adaptable tool usage strategies. Furthermore, our focus on open-source LLMs\ndistinguishes our work from previous studies that primarily focused on proprietary models.\n\nThe use of self-instruction for improving LLM capabilities has gained increasing attention [6,\n7]. These methods typically involve generating a large dataset of instructions and corresponding\nresponses, which are then used to fine-tune the LLM. Our work extends this approach by incorporating\ntool usage into the self-instruction framework. This allows the model to learn not only to generate\nappropriate responses but also to select and utilize the appropriate tools for a given task. The\nintegration of tool usage into the self-instruction process is a key innovation that distinguishes our\nwork from previous studies. This allows for a more holistic approach to LLM training, leading to\nmore robust and versatile models.\n\nOur approach also relates to work on multi-modal learning [8, 9], which focuses on integrating\ndifferent modalities, such as text and images, into a unified framework. While many multi-modal\n\n2\n\n\fmodels have been developed, they often lack the ability to seamlessly integrate with external tools.\nOur work bridges this gap by providing a framework for integrating LLMs with multi-modal tools,\nenabling them to perform complex tasks involving visual comprehension and image generation. The\nability to handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios is a key advantage\nof our approach. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wider\nrange of applications.\n\nFinally, our work contributes to the broader goal of democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities.\nBy focusing on open-source LLMs and providing a simple, efficient, and scalable framework for\ntool integration, we aim to empower researchers and developers to build more powerful and versatile\nAI systems. The modular design of our framework allows for easy extension and customization,\nmaking it suitable for a wide range of applications and user needs. The ability to generalize to unseen\ntools and tasks is a crucial aspect of our approach, ensuring that the resulting systems are robust and\nadaptable to evolving requirements.",
  "methodology": "Our methodology centers on a self-instruction framework designed to empower open-source LLMs\nlike LLaMA, Vicuna, and OPT to effectively utilize multi-modal tools for visual comprehension\nand image generation tasks. This framework directly addresses the limitations of these open-source\nmodels compared to proprietary counterparts such as GPT-3.5, particularly in handling complex\ninteractions with external tools. The core of our approach lies in enabling these open-source models\nto handle both seen and unseen tools in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. This is achieved through\na novel combination of prompt engineering and reinforcement learning techniques, meticulously\ndesigned to enhance the model\u2019s understanding and utilization of tool descriptions. The framework\u2019s\nmodularity allows for seamless integration of a wide range of visual tools without extensive retraining,\na significant advantage over existing methods that often require substantial model re-adaptation for\neach new tool. This efficiency is crucial for scalability and broad applicability.\n\nThe self-instruction process begins with the generation of a diverse dataset comprising instructions\nand corresponding tool usage examples. These examples are carefully crafted to encompass a wide\nspectrum of task complexities and scenarios, ensuring the model receives a rich and varied learning\nexperience. The diversity of the dataset is paramount in enabling the model to generalize effectively\nto unseen tools and tasks. The examples are designed to explicitly demonstrate the appropriate\nselection and application of tools for specific tasks, providing the model with clear guidance on how\nto leverage the tools effectively. This detailed instruction set is crucial for overcoming the limitations\nof simple imitation learning, allowing the model to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship\nbetween tasks, instructions, and tool usage.\n\nReinforcement learning plays a crucial role in refining the model\u2019s tool usage strategies. We employ a\nreward function that incentivizes the model to select and utilize tools optimally, leading to improved\nperformance on the target tasks. The reward function is designed to consider both the correctness\nof the model\u2019s output and the efficiency of its tool usage. This dual focus ensures that the model\nnot only produces accurate results but also learns to select the most appropriate tools for a given\nsituation, demonstrating a level of strategic thinking beyond simple imitation. The iterative nature of\nthe reinforcement learning process allows for continuous improvement, leading to increasingly robust\nand adaptable tool usage strategies. This iterative refinement is key to achieving high performance on\na wide range of tasks.\n\nThe training process involves iteratively generating new instructions and tool usage examples based\non the model\u2019s performance. This iterative approach allows the model to learn from its mistakes and\ncontinuously improve its understanding of tool usage. The generated examples are carefully reviewed\nand curated to ensure their quality and relevance. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures that the\nmodel is trained on high-quality data, leading to improved performance. The iterative nature of the\nprocess also allows for the incorporation of new tools and tasks as needed, ensuring the framework\u2019s\nadaptability and longevity. This continuous improvement cycle is a key differentiator of our approach,\nleading to a more robust and versatile system.\n\nOur evaluation focuses on a range of visual tasks, including image captioning, visual question\nanswering, and image generation. We assess the model\u2019s performance on both seen and unseen\ntools, evaluating its ability to generalize to new situations. We compare the performance of our\n\n3\n\n\fapproach to existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.\nThe results highlight the effectiveness of our self-instruction framework in enabling open-source\nLLMs to achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of proprietary\nmodels. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the model\u2019s performance provides valuable insights into the\ninterplay between language understanding, tool selection, and task execution, highlighting the crucial\nrole of accurate instruction interpretation in successful tool utilization.

  "introduction": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while pre-\nserving their inherent equivariance properties. Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a model\u2019s\noutput transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications,\nincluding image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structured\ndata. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property,\nleading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stems\nfrom the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many\ndatasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequence\nis a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizable\nperformance.\n\nOur work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that\nexplicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring\nthat the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed\nregularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated\ninto the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to\nrespect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the\ngroup structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable\nequivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods\nthat treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich\nstructural information embedded within the data.\n\nThe proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which\nhave demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network\narchitectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extending\nthese techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in large\npretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance. This allows us to leverage the\nsubstantial computational investment already made in training these large models, avoiding the need\n\n.\n\n\ffor extensive training from scratch. The combination of pretrained model knowledge and equivariance\npreservation offers a powerful approach to efficient and effective model adaptation.\n\nWe evaluate our method on a diverse range of benchmark datasets encompassing image classification,\nobject detection, and physics simulation tasks. Our results consistently demonstrate the superiority\nof our approach over traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. We\nobserve significant improvements in generalization performance, particularly in low-data regimes,\nhighlighting the crucial role of equivariance preservation in robust and generalizable model adaptation.\nFurthermore, our detailed analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively\nprevents the disruption of equivariance during the adaptation process, validating the core principle of\nour approach.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper presents a novel and effective method for adapting large pretrained models\nwhile preserving their valuable equivariance properties. Our approach offers a significant advancement\nin model adaptation, enabling the efficient and effective utilization of pretrained models in a wider\nrange of applications. The results demonstrate the importance of considering group symmetries\nduring model adaptation and showcase the potential of our method for various domains. Future work\nwill focus on extending our method to more complex group structures and exploring its applications\nin other challenging scenarios.",
  "related_work": "This section reviews existing literature relevant to our work on equivariant adaptation of large\npretrained models. Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development\nof equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas\nseparately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method.\n\nThe field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. These\nnetworks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring\nthat the model\u2019s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectures\nhave been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and other\ntechniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as image\nclassification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing work\nfocuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and\nrequire large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting\npretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance.\n\nThe adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniques\nsuch as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained\nmodels to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the\npretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation\ntechniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to\nperformance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured\npoints in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this\nlimitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that\nthe adapted model retains its equivariance.\n\nSeveral works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance,\nsome studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques such\nas knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod-\nifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and\nefficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term\nderived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to\nleverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant\narchitectural changes.\n\nIn contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and\nequivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge\nencoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,\nwhile simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed\nregularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared\n\n2\n\n\fto existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent\nsymmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting\nlarge pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties.",
  "methodology": "This section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our\napproach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,\nensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel\nregularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain\nthe adaptation process such that the model\u2019s output transforms predictably under group actions on the\ninput, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often\ndisrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the\ngroup structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in\na high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of\npretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for\nlarge models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness\noften outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section.\n\nOur method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves\ndetermining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input\nand output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations and\ntranslations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group\nrepresentation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process.\nSpecifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model\u2019s output under a\ngroup action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized\nduring training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of\nthe regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance\npreservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is\ndetermined through cross-validation.\n\nThe regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall loss\nfunction is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the\nequivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance\nand equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss\nfunction using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.\nThe specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics\nof the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for\nachieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings\nfor each experiment.\n\nThe implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include\nthe equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model\u2019s weights and\narchitecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term\nis computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-\nputational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning\nframeworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility\nand further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and\noptimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material.\n\nFinally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the new\ntask. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification\nor mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is\ncompared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation\ntechniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while\nachieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in the\nnext section.\n\n3",
  "experiments": "This section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed\nmethod for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a variety of\ntasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art\nadaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in\npreserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data\nregimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model\u2019s\nequivariance properties. The results highlight the importance of considering group symmetries\nduring model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various applications. The\ncomputational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed.\n\nOur experiments involve three distinct tasks: image classification, object detection, and a physics\nsimulation task involving the prediction of fluid dynamics. For image classification, we utilize the\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7\nmodels. The group structure considered is the group of rotations and translations, represented using\nappropriate group convolutions. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt\na pretrained Faster R-CNN model. Here, the group structure is again the group of rotations and\ntranslations, but the regularization is adapted to the specific architecture of the object detection\nmodel. Finally, for the physics simulation task, we use a dataset of fluid flow simulations, adapting\na pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure in this case is the group of spatial\ntranslations and reflections. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method,\nincluding the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation.\n\nThe results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and\nother adaptation techniques. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three\ntasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially\nin low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving\nequivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This highlights\nthe importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. Furthermore,\nour analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of\nequivariance during the adaptation process, as measured by the discrepancy between the model\u2019s\noutput under group actions and the transformed output. This validates the core principle of our\napproach.\n\nTable 1: Performance comparison of our method against traditional fine-tuning and other adaptation\ntechniques across three tasks.\n\nMethod\n\nImage Classification (CIFAR-10) Object Detection (COCO)\n\nPhysics Simulation\n\nFine-tuning\nMethod A (State-of-the-art)\nOur Method\n\n85.2%\n88.1%\n90.5%\n\n32.5 mAP\n35.1 mAP\n37.8 mAP\n\n0.85 RMSE\n0.80 RMSE\n0.72 RMSE\n\nThe computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex\ngroup structures.

We explore strategies for mitigating the computational overhead, such as using\nefficient group convolution implementations and employing techniques like stochastic optimization.\nFurther research is needed to optimize the computational efficiency of our method, particularly for\nextremely large models and complex group structures. Despite this, the results presented demonstrate\nthe significant potential of our approach for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models to new\ntasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring\napplications to even more complex scenarios.",
  "results": "This section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariantly\nadapting large pretrained models.

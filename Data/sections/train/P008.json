  "introduction": "This research delves into the mechanisms underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a technique\nthat significantly boosts the performance of large language models (LLMs) on intricate reasoning tasks.\nCoT achieves this enhancement by strategically decomposing complex problems into a sequence\nof simpler, more manageable sub-problems. Our investigation centers on understanding how this\ndecomposition process impacts the model\u2019s learning and reasoning capabilities, particularly within\nthe context of in-context learning (ICL). We focus on compositional functions, using multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) as a representative model architecture, to analyze the effects of CoT on various\naspects of model performance.\n\nA key aspect of our study is the examination of CoT\u2019s influence on sample complexity. We hypothesize\nthat by breaking down complex tasks, CoT reduces the number of training examples required to\nachieve a given level of accuracy. This reduction in sample complexity is crucial for efficient training\nand deployment of LLMs, especially when dealing with limited datasets or computationally expensive\ntraining processes. Furthermore, we explore how CoT affects the approximation power of the model,\ninvestigating whether the decomposition process allows the model to learn and represent more\ncomplex functions effectively. Our analysis considers the interplay between the complexity of the\ntarget function, the number of training examples, and the length of the CoT prompts.\n\nThe impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of our\nresearch. We investigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient\nlearning during pretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit\nthat the decomposition inherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable\nrepresentations, which are less susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This\n\n.\n\n\faspect is crucial for building LLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains.\nOur empirical analysis involves a series of experiments designed to validate these hypotheses.\n\nOur theoretical analysis complements the empirical findings, providing a deeper understanding of\nthe mechanisms by which CoT improves LLM performance. We develop a framework that explains\nhow the structured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more interpretable and\nefficient solution space. This framework helps to clarify why CoT consistently outperforms standard\nICL, particularly on complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer\nvaluable guidance for the design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies, paving the way for\nthe development of more effective and efficient LLM training methods.\n\nIn summary, this research provides a comprehensive investigation into the efficacy of CoT prompting.\nWe present both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating its significant impact on sample\ncomplexity, approximation power, and generalization capabilities of LLMs. Our findings contribute\nto a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of CoT and offer valuable insights for future\nresearch in the development and application of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. The results have\nsignificant implications for the broader field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of\nefficient and effective LLM training and deployment.",
  "related_work": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) [1, 2]. Our work builds upon this line of research,\nfocusing specifically on the impact of CoT on in-context learning (ICL) of compositional functions,\nparticularly within the context of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Previous studies have demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of CoT in various tasks, such as question answering and commonsense reasoning [3,\n4], but a comprehensive analysis of its influence on sample complexity and approximation power\nwithin the framework of ICL remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to fill this gap\nby providing a detailed investigation of CoT\u2019s mechanisms and its implications for efficient LLM\ntraining and deployment. We leverage both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of how CoT facilitates the learning of complex functions.\n\nThe reduction of sample complexity is a crucial aspect of our investigation. While prior work has\ntouched upon the potential of CoT to reduce the number of training examples needed [5], a systematic\nanalysis of this effect across different function complexities and prompt lengths is lacking. Our\nstudy addresses this by conducting extensive experiments to quantify the impact of CoT on sample\ncomplexity, providing quantitative evidence of its efficiency gains. Furthermore, we explore the\nrelationship between CoT prompt length and model performance, investigating the optimal balance\nbetween detailed intermediate steps and computational efficiency. This analysis contributes to the\ndevelopment of more effective and efficient CoT prompting strategies.\n\nOur research also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CoT\u2019s success. Existing explanations\noften focus on heuristic interpretations of CoT\u2019s behavior [6], but a rigorous theoretical framework is\nneeded to fully understand its impact on generalization and approximation power. We address this by\ndeveloping a theoretical model that explains how CoT guides the model towards a more structured\nand interpretable solution space, leading to improved generalization capabilities. This framework\nprovides a deeper understanding of why CoT consistently outperforms standard ICL, particularly on\ncomplex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer valuable guidance for\nthe design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies.\n\nThe impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of our\nresearch. While the benefits of pretraining are well-established [7], the specific role of CoT in en-\nhancing pretraining efficiency and generalization remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates\nwhether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during pretraining,\nresulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit that the decomposition\ninherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable representations, which are\nless susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This aspect is crucial for building\nLLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nFinally, our work contrasts with previous research by focusing on the specific context of compo-\nsitional functions and MLPs. While many studies have explored CoT in the context of natural\n\n2\n\n\flanguage processing tasks, a detailed analysis of its impact on the learning of compositional functions\nwithin a simpler, more controlled setting like MLPs provides valuable insights into the fundamental\nmechanisms underlying CoT\u2019s effectiveness. This allows us to isolate the effects of CoT from other\nfactors that might influence performance in more complex NLP tasks. Our findings offer a more\nnuanced understanding of CoT\u2019s capabilities and limitations, paving the way for future research in\nthis area.",
  "methodology": "This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical analysis with empirical\nexperimentation to investigate the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Our\ntheoretical framework focuses on understanding how CoT\u2019s decomposition of complex problems\ninto simpler steps influences the learning process of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in the context\nof in-context learning (ICL). We analyze how this decomposition affects the model\u2019s ability to\nlearn compositional functions, focusing on the impact on sample complexity and approximation\npower. This theoretical analysis involves developing a mathematical model to capture the relationship\nbetween CoT prompt length, function complexity, and model performance. We explore how the\nstructured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more efficient and interpretable\nsolution space, leading to improved generalization. The theoretical framework is designed to provide\na principled explanation for the observed empirical results.\n\nOur empirical investigation involves a series of experiments designed to validate our theoretical\nhypotheses and quantify the effects of CoT. We use a range of MLP architectures and reasoning tasks\nof varying complexity, systematically varying the number of training examples and the length of the\nCoT prompts. For each experiment, we measure the model\u2019s accuracy and compare the performance\nof CoT prompting against standard ICL. The experiments are designed to assess the impact of CoT\non sample complexity, measuring the reduction in the number of training examples required to\nachieve a given level of accuracy. We also analyze the relationship between CoT prompt length and\nmodel performance, identifying the optimal prompt length for different tasks and model architectures.\nThe data collected from these experiments is used to validate our theoretical model and provide\nquantitative evidence of CoT\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nThe datasets used in our experiments consist of synthetically generated data designed to represent\ncompositional functions of varying complexity. This allows us to control the complexity of the tasks\nand isolate the effects of CoT from other factors that might influence performance in more complex\nreal-world datasets. The synthetic data is generated using a set of predefined rules, ensuring that the\nfunctions are well-defined and their complexity can be precisely controlled. This approach allows for\na more rigorous and controlled evaluation of CoT\u2019s impact on sample complexity and approximation\npower. We also explore the use of different prompting strategies, varying the level of guidance\nprovided in the CoT prompts and the types of intermediate steps included.\n\nThe evaluation metrics used in our experiments include accuracy, sample complexity (measured\nas the number of training examples required to achieve a given accuracy level), and generalization\nperformance (measured on a held-out test set). We use statistical tests, such as t-tests, to compare\nthe performance of CoT prompting against standard ICL. The results are presented in tables and\nfigures, showing the impact of CoT on each of the evaluation metrics across different experimental\nconditions. The analysis of these results focuses on identifying the key factors that contribute to CoT\u2019s\neffectiveness and understanding the limitations of the approach. We also investigate the relationship\nbetween the theoretical predictions of our model and the empirical results, assessing the validity and\nrobustness of our theoretical framework.\n\nFinally, we analyze the impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development. We inves-\ntigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during\npretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. This involves comparing\nthe performance of models pretrained with and without CoT on a range of downstream tasks. We\nanalyze the learned representations of the models to understand how CoT influences the model\u2019s\ninternal representations and its ability to generalize to unseen data. The results of this analysis\nprovide insights into the long-term benefits of incorporating CoT into the LLM training pipeline.\nThis comprehensive approach allows us to gain a deep understanding of CoT\u2019s mechanisms and its\nimplications for efficient and effective LLM training and deployment.\n\n3",
  "experiments": "This section details the experimental setup and results of our investigation into Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting. We designed experiments to systematically evaluate CoT\u2019s impact on sample\ncomplexity, approximation power, and generalization ability in the context of in-context learning\n(ICL) for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) solving compositional functions. Our experiments involved\nvarying the complexity of the target functions, the number of training examples provided, and the\nlength of the CoT prompts. We compared the performance of models trained with CoT prompting\nagainst those trained with standard ICL, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The\nexperiments were conducted using synthetic datasets to ensure controlled evaluation and precise\nmanipulation of function complexity. We generated datasets with varying levels of noise to assess the\nrobustness of CoT under different conditions. The MLP architectures used were carefully selected to\nrepresent a range of model capacities, allowing us to investigate the scalability of CoT\u2019s benefits. We\nemployed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the reliability of our findings.\n\nOur first set of experiments focused on sample complexity. We trained MLPs on compositional\nfunctions of varying complexity, using different numbers of training examples and CoT prompt\nlengths. The results consistently demonstrated that CoT significantly reduced the sample complexity\ncompared to standard ICL. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the number of training examples\nand accuracy for both CoT and ICL across different function complexities. As expected, CoT\nconsistently outperformed ICL, requiring significantly fewer examples to achieve the same level of\naccuracy, particularly for more complex functions. This reduction in sample complexity highlights\nCoT\u2019s efficiency in learning from limited data. Further analysis revealed a non-linear relationship\nbetween CoT prompt length and sample complexity reduction, suggesting an optimal prompt length\nexists for each task and model complexity. Excessively long prompts did not always lead to further\nimprovements, indicating a potential trade-off between detail and computational cost.\n\nFigure 1: Sample Complexity Comparison: CoT vs. ICL\n[width=0.8]samplecomplexityplot.pdf\n\nNext, we investigated CoT\u2019s impact on approximation power. We evaluated the ability of models\ntrained with and without CoT to accurately represent functions of increasing complexity. Table\n1 summarizes the results. The table shows that CoT consistently improved the model\u2019s ability to\napproximate complex functions, achieving higher accuracy than ICL across all complexity levels.\nThis suggests that CoT facilitates the learning of more intricate relationships within the data, enabling\nthe model to capture the underlying structure of the compositional functions more effectively. The\nimprovement was particularly pronounced for functions requiring multiple reasoning steps, further\nsupporting the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model\u2019s capacity for compositional reasoning.\n\nTable 1: Approximation Power Comparison: CoT vs. ICL\n\nFunction Complexity\n\nICL Accuracy CoT Accuracy\n\nImprovement\n\nLow\nMedium\nHigh\n\n0.85\n0.70\n0.55\n\n0.92\n0.85\n0.78\n\n0.07\n0.15\n0.23\n\nOur final set of experiments focused on generalization. We evaluated the performance of models\ntrained with and without CoT on a held-out test set. The results showed that CoT led to significant\nimprovements in generalization performance, indicating that the structured reasoning facilitated by\nCoT promotes the learning of more robust and transferable representations. This enhanced gener-\nalization ability is crucial for deploying models in real-world scenarios where the data distribution\nmay differ from the training data. The improvement in generalization was consistent across different\nfunction complexities and prompt lengths, suggesting that CoT\u2019s benefits extend beyond specific task\ncharacteristics. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model\u2019s ability\nto learn generalizable representations, leading to improved performance on unseen data. Further\nanalysis revealed a correlation between the length of the CoT prompt and generalization performance,\nwith longer prompts generally leading to better generalization, up to a certain point beyond which\ndiminishing returns were observed.\n\n4\n\n\fThe overall results of our experiments strongly support the hypothesis that CoT prompting signif-\nicantly enhances the performance of MLPs on compositional reasoning tasks. CoT consistently\nimproved sample complexity, approximation power, and generalization ability, demonstrating its\neffectiveness as a method for improving the efficiency and robustness of in-context learning. These\nfindings have significant implications for the development and deployment of large language models,\nsuggesting that CoT can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of these models on complex\nreasoning tasks. Further research could explore the application of CoT to other model architectures\nand task domains, as well as the development of more sophisticated prompting strategies.\n\n5",

The Importance of Written Explanations in
Aggregating Crowdsourced Predictions

Abstract

This study demonstrates that incorporating the written explanations provided by
individuals when making predictions enhances the accuracy of aggregated crowd-
sourced forecasts. The research shows that while majority and weighted vote
methods are effective, the inclusion of written justifications improves forecast
accuracy throughout most of a question’s duration, with the exception of its final
phase. Furthermore, the study analyzes the attributes that differentiate reliable and
unreliable justifications.

Introduction

The concept of the "wisdom of the crowd" posits that combining information from numerous non-
expert individuals can produce answers that are as accurate as, or even more accurate than, those
provided by a single expert. A classic example of this concept is the observation that the median
estimate of an ox’s weight from a large group of fair attendees was remarkably close to the actual
weight. While generally supported, the idea is not without its limitations. Historical examples
demonstrate instances where crowds behaved irrationally, and even a world chess champion was able
to defeat the combined moves of a crowd.

In the current era, the advantages of collective intelligence are widely utilized. For example, Wikipedia
relies on the contributions of volunteers, and community-driven question-answering platforms have
garnered significant attention from the research community. When compiling information from
large groups, it is important to determine whether the individual inputs were made independently. If
not, factors like group psychology and the influence of persuasive arguments can skew individual
judgments, thus negating the positive effects of crowd wisdom.

This paper focuses on forecasts concerning questions spanning political, economic, and social
domains. Each forecast includes a prediction, estimating the probability of a particular event, and
a written justification that explains the reasoning behind the prediction. Forecasts with identical
predictions can have justifications of varying strength, which, in turn, affects the perceived reliability
of the predictions. For instance, a justification that simply refers to an external source without
explanation may appear to rely heavily on the prevailing opinion of the crowd and might be considered
weaker than a justification that presents specific, verifiable facts from external resources.

To clarify the terminology used: a "question" is defined as a statement that seeks information (e.g.,
"Will new legislation be implemented before a certain date?"). Questions have a defined start and
end date, and the period between these dates constitutes the "life" of the question. "Forecasters"
are individuals who provide a "forecast," which consists of a "prediction" and a "justification." The
prediction is a numerical representation of the likelihood of an event occurring. The justification
is the text provided by the forecaster to support their prediction. The central problem addressed in
this work is termed "calling a question," which refers to the process of determining a final prediction
by aggregating individual forecasts. Two strategies are employed for calling questions each day
throughout their life: considering forecasts submitted on the given day ("daily") and considering the
last forecast submitted by each forecaster ("active").

Inspired by prior research on recognizing and fostering skilled forecasters, and analyzing written
justifications to assess the quality of individual or collective forecasts, this paper investigates the
automated calling of questions throughout their duration based on the forecasts available each day.
The primary contributions are empirical findings that address the following research questions:

* When making a prediction on a specific day, is it advantageous to include forecasts from previous
days? (Yes) * Does the accuracy of the prediction improve when considering the question itself
and the written justifications provided with the forecasts? (Yes) * Is it easier to make an accurate
prediction toward the end of a question’s duration? (Yes) * Are written justifications more valuable
when the crowd’s predictions are less accurate? (Yes)

In addition, this research presents an examination of the justifications associated with both accurate
and inaccurate forecasts. This analysis aims to identify the features that contribute to a justification
being more or less credible.

2 Related Work

The language employed by individuals is indicative of various characteristics. Prior research includes
both predictive models (using language samples to predict attributes about the author) and models
that provide valuable insights (using language samples and author attributes to identify differentiating
linguistic features). Previous studies have examined factors such as gender and age, political ideology,
health outcomes, and personality traits. In this paper, models are constructed to predict outcomes
based on crowd-sourced forecasts without knowledge of individual forecasters’ identities.

Previous research has also explored how language use varies depending on the relationships between
individuals. For instance, studies have analyzed language patterns in social networks, online commu-
nities, and corporate emails to understand how individuals in positions of authority communicate.
Similarly, researchers have examined how language provides insights into interpersonal interactions
and relationships. In terms of language form and function, prior research has investigated politeness,
empathy, advice, condolences, usefulness, and deception. Related to the current study’s focus,
researchers have examined the influence of Wikipedia editors and studied influence levels within
online communities. Persuasion has also been analyzed from a computational perspective, including
within the context of dialogue systems. The work presented here complements these previous studies.
The goal is to identify credible justifications to improve the aggregation of crowdsourced forecasts,
without explicitly targeting any of the aforementioned characteristics.

Within the field of computational linguistics, the task most closely related to this research is argumen-
tation. A strong justification for a forecast can be considered a well-reasoned supporting argument.
Previous work in this area includes identifying argument components such as claims, premises,
backing, rebuttals, and refutations, as well as mining arguments that support or oppose a particular
claim. Despite these efforts, it was found that crowdsourced justifications rarely adhere to these
established argumentation frameworks, even though such justifications are valuable for aggregating
forecasts.

Finally, several studies have focused on forecasting using datasets similar or identical to the one used
in this research. From a psychological perspective, researchers have explored strategies for enhancing
forecasting accuracy, such as utilizing top-performing forecasters (often called "superforecasters"),
and have analyzed the traits that contribute to their success. These studies aim to identify and cultivate
superforecasters but do not incorporate the written justifications accompanying forecasts. In contrast,
the present research develops models to call questions without using any information about the
forecasters themselves. Within the field of computational linguistics, researchers have evaluated the
language used in high-quality justifications, focusing on aspects like rating, benefit, and influence.
Other researchers have developed models to predict forecaster skill using the textual justifications
from specific datasets, such as the Good Judgment Open data, and have also applied these models
to predict the accuracy of individual forecasts in other contexts, such as company earnings reports.
However, none of these prior works have specifically aimed to call questions throughout their entire
duration.

3 Dataset

The research utilizes data from the Good Judgment Open, a platform where questions are posted, and
individuals submit their forecasts. The questions primarily revolve around geopolitics, encompassing
areas such as domestic and international politics, the economy, and social matters. For this study, all
binary questions were collected, along with their associated forecasts, each comprising a prediction
and a justification. In total, the dataset contains 441 questions and 96,664 forecasts submitted
over 32,708 days. This dataset significantly expands upon previous research, nearly doubling the
number of forecasts analyzed. Since the objective is to accurately call questions throughout their
entire duration, all forecasts with written justifications are included, regardless of factors such as
justification length or the number of forecasts submitted by a single forecaster. Additionally, this
approach prioritizes privacy, as no information about the individual forecasters is utilized.

Table 1 provides a basic analysis of the questions in the dataset. The majority of questions are
relatively lengthy, containing more than 16 tokens and multiple named entities, with geopolitical,
person, and date entities being the most frequent. In terms of duration, half of the questions remain
open for nearly two months, and 75% are open for more than three weeks.

An examination of the topics covered by the questions using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
reveals three primary themes: elections (including terms like "voting," "winners," and "candidate"),
government actions (including terms like "negotiations," "announcements," "meetings," and "passing
(a law)"), and wars and violent crimes (including terms like "groups," "killing," "civilian (casualties),"
and "arms"). Although not explicitly represented in the LDA topics, the questions address both
domestic and international events within these broad themes.

Table 2: Analysis of the 96,664 written justifications submitted by forecasters in our dataset. The
readability scores indicate that most justifications are easily understood by high school students (11th
or 12th grade), although a substantial amount (>25%) require a college education (Flesch under 50 or
Dale-Chall over 9.0).

Table 2 presents a fundamental analysis of the 96,664 forecast justifications in the dataset. The median
length is relatively short, consisting of one sentence and 23 tokens. Justifications mention named
entities less frequently than the questions themselves. Interestingly, half of the justifications contain
at least one negation, and 25% include three or more. This suggests that forecasters sometimes base
their predictions on events that might not occur or have not yet occurred. The sentiment polarity of

3

the justifications is generally neutral. In terms of readability, both the Flesch and Dale-Chall scores
suggest that approximately a quarter of the justifications require a college-level education for full
comprehension.

Regarding verbs and nouns, an analysis using WordNet lexical files reveals that the most common
verb classes are "change" (e.g., "happen," "remain," "increase"), "social" (e.g., "vote," "support,"
"help"), "cognition" (e.g., "think," "believe," "know"), and "motion" (e.g., "go," "come," "leave").
The most frequent noun classes are "act" (e.g., "election," "support," "deal"), "communication" (e.g.,
"questions," "forecast," "news"), "cognition" (e.g., "point," "issue," "possibility"), and "group" (e.g.,
"government," "people," "party").

4 Experiments and Results

Experiments are conducted to address the challenge of accurately calling a question throughout
its duration. The input consists of the question itself and the associated forecasts (predictions and
justifications), while the output is an aggregated answer to the question derived from all forecasts.
The number of instances corresponds to the total number of days all questions were open. Both
simple baselines and a neural network are employed, considering both (a) daily forecasts and (b)
active forecasts submitted up to ten days prior.

The questions are divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Subsequently, all forecasts
submitted throughout the duration of each question are assigned to their respective subsets. It’s
important to note that randomly splitting the forecasts would be an inappropriate approach. This is
because forecasts for the same question submitted on different days would be distributed across the
training, validation, and test subsets, leading to data leakage and inaccurate performance evaluation.

4.1 Baselines

Two unsupervised baselines are considered. The "majority vote" baseline determines the answer to a
question based on the most frequent prediction among the forecasts. The "weighted vote" baseline,
on the other hand, assigns weights to the probabilities in the predictions and then aggregates them.

4.2 Neural Network Architecture

A neural network architecture is employed, which consists of three main components: one to generate
a representation of the question, another to generate a representation of each forecast, and an LSTM
to process the sequence of forecasts and ultimately call the question.

The representation of a question is obtained using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256
neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout. The representation of a forecast is created by concatenating
three elements: (a) a binary flag indicating whether the forecast was submitted on the day the question
is being called or on a previous day, (b) the prediction itself (a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0),
and (c) a representation of the justification. The representation of the justification is also obtained
using BERT, followed by a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, ReLU activation, and dropout.
The LSTM has a hidden state with a dimensionality of 256 and processes the sequence of forecasts
as its input. During the tuning process, it was discovered that providing the representation of the
question alongside each forecast is more effective than processing forecasts independently of the
question. Consequently, the representation of the question is concatenated with the representation of
each forecast before being fed into the LSTM. Finally, the last hidden state of the LSTM is connected
to a fully connected layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation to produce the final prediction
for the question.

4.3 Architecture Ablation

Experiments are carried out with the complete neural architecture, as described above, as well as
with variations where certain components are disabled. Specifically, the representation of a forecast
is manipulated by incorporating different combinations of information:

4

* Only the prediction. * The prediction and the representation of the question. * The prediction and
the representation of the justification. * The prediction, the representation of the question, and the
representation of the justification.

4.4 Quantitative Results

The evaluation metric used is accuracy, which represents the average percentage of days a model
correctly calls a question throughout its duration. Results are reported for all days combined, as well
as for each of the four quartiles of the question’s duration.

Despite their relative simplicity, the baseline methods achieve commendable results, demonstrating
that aggregating forecaster predictions without considering the question or justifications is a viable
strategy. However, the full neural network achieves significantly improved results.

**Using Daily or Active Forecasts** Incorporating active forecasts, rather than solely relying on
forecasts submitted on the day the question is called, proves advantageous for both baselines and all
neural network configurations, except for the one using only predictions and justifications.

**Encoding Questions and Justifications** The neural network that only utilizes the prediction
to represent a forecast surpasses both baseline methods. Notably, integrating the question, the
justification, or both into the forecast representation yields further improvements. These results
indicate that incorporating the question and forecaster-provided justifications into the model enhances
the accuracy of question calling.

**Calling Questions Throughout Their Life** When examining the results across the four quartiles of
a question’s duration, it’s observed that while using active forecasts is beneficial across all quartiles
for both baselines and all network configurations, the neural networks surprisingly outperform the
baselines only in the first three quartiles. In the last quartile, the neural networks perform significantly
worse than the baselines. This suggests that while modeling questions and justifications is generally
helpful, it becomes detrimental toward the end of a question’s life. This phenomenon can be attributed
to the increasing wisdom of the crowd as more evidence becomes available and more forecasters
contribute, making their aggregated predictions more accurate.

**Calling Questions Based on Their Difficulty** The analysis is further refined by examining
results based on question difficulty, determined by the number of days the best-performing baseline
incorrectly calls the question. This helps to understand which questions benefit most from the neural
networks that incorporate questions and justifications. However, it’s important to note that calculating
question difficulty during the question’s active period is not feasible, making these experiments
unrealistic before the question closes and the correct answer is revealed.

Table 4 presents the results for selected models based on question difficulty. The weighted vote
baseline demonstrates superior performance for 75

5 Qualitative Analysis

This section provides insights into the factors that make questions more difficult to forecast and
examines the characteristics of justifications associated with incorrect and correct predictions.

**Questions** An analysis of the 88 questions in the test set revealed that questions called incorrectly
on at least one day by the best model tend to have a shorter duration (69.4 days vs. 81.7 days) and a
higher number of active forecasts per day (31.0 vs. 26.7). This suggests that the model’s errors align
with the questions that forecasters also find challenging.

**Justifications** A manual review of 400 justifications (200 associated with incorrect predictions
and 200 with correct predictions) was conducted, focusing on those submitted on days when the best
model made an incorrect prediction. The following observations were made:

* A higher percentage of incorrect predictions (78%) were accompanied by short justifications
(fewer than 20 tokens), compared to 65% for correct predictions. This supports the idea that longer
user-generated text often indicates higher quality. * References to previous forecasts (either by the
same or other forecasters, or the current crowd’s forecast) were more common in justifications for
incorrect predictions (31.5%) than for correct predictions (16%). * A lack of a logical argument
was prevalent in the justifications, regardless of the prediction’s accuracy. However, it was more
frequent in justifications for incorrect predictions (62.5%) than for correct predictions (47.5%). *
Surprisingly, justifications with generic arguments did not clearly differentiate between incorrect and
correct predictions (16.0% vs. 14.5%). * Poor grammar and spelling or the use of non-English were
infrequent but more common in justifications for incorrect predictions (24.5%) compared to correct
predictions (14.5%).

6 Conclusions

Forecasting involves predicting future events, a capability highly valued by both governments and
industries as it enables them to anticipate and address potential challenges. This study focuses on
questions spanning the political, economic, and social domains, utilizing forecasts submitted by a
crowd of individuals without specialized training. Each forecast comprises a prediction and a natural
language justification.

6

The research demonstrates that aggregating the weighted predictions of forecasters is a solid baseline
for calling a question throughout its duration. However, models that incorporate both the question
and the justifications achieve significantly better results, particularly during the first three quartiles of
a question’s life. Importantly, the models developed in this study do not profile individual forecasters
or utilize any information about their identities. This work lays the groundwork for evaluating the
credibility of anonymous forecasts, enabling the development of robust aggregation strategies that do
not require tracking individual forecasters.

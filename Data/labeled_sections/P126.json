  "introduction": "The objective of this research is to develop an innovative algorithm for accurately estimating the\ncausal effect of treatment on outcomes in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) when latent\nconfounders are present. Existing methods often struggle in this scenario, typically requiring\nmultiple proxy variables to account for the unobserved confounding or relying on strong, often\nunrealistic, assumptions about the data generating process. These limitations significantly restrict\nthe applicability of these methods in real-world settings where obtaining multiple reliable proxies\ncan be challenging or even impossible. Our proposed approach offers a significant advancement by\nleveraging a single proxy variable, combined with information extracted from cross-moments of the\nobserved variables, to identify and estimate causal effects. This reduction in data requirements makes\nour method considerably more practical and widely applicable. The algorithm\u2019s robustness to model\nmisspecification and its ability to handle high-dimensional data are also key features, enhancing its\nutility in complex real-world scenarios.\n\nThe core innovation lies in the strategic use of cross-moments to capture the intricate relationships\nbetween the observed variables and the latent confounder. By carefully analyzing these relationships,\nour algorithm effectively disentangles the direct effect of the treatment from the indirect effect\nmediated by the latent confounder. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the causal effect,\neven in the presence of significant confounding bias. The theoretical foundations of the algorithm\nare rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and providing a solid basis for its application. We\ndemonstrate the algorithm\u2019s effectiveness through extensive simulations, comparing its performance\nagainst state-of-the-art methods under various conditions, including varying levels of confounding\nand noise. These simulations highlight the algorithm\u2019s superior accuracy and robustness.\n\nFurthermore, we showcase the practical applicability of our algorithm through real-world case studies.\nThese applications demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s ability to provide valuable causal insights in settings\n\n.\n\n\fwhere traditional methods fail. The algorithm\u2019s efficiency and scalability make it particularly suitable\nfor large-scale datasets, a significant advantage in the era of big data. This capability addresses\na critical limitation of many existing causal inference techniques, which often struggle with the\ncomputational demands of large datasets. The potential applications of this algorithm extend to\ndiverse fields, including healthcare, economics, and social sciences, where understanding causal\nrelationships is crucial for informed decision-making.\n\nOur work contributes significantly to the field of causal inference by providing a practical and\npowerful tool for researchers and practitioners. The algorithm\u2019s ability to handle latent confounders\nwith a single proxy variable represents a major breakthrough, simplifying the data requirements\nfor causal inference and broadening its accessibility. This simplification is particularly valuable in\nsituations where data collection is expensive or limited. The algorithm\u2019s robustness and efficiency\nmake it a promising candidate for widespread adoption in causal inference applications across various\ndisciplines. Future work will focus on extending the algorithm to handle non-linear SCMs and\nexploring its application in more complex causal inference settings, such as those involving multiple\ntreatments or mediators. The development of user-friendly software implementing this algorithm is\nalso a priority to facilitate its wider adoption and use.\n\nIn summary, this research presents a novel and efficient algorithm for causal inference in the presence\nof latent confounders. Its ability to leverage a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and\nscalability, makes it a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm\u2019s theoretical foundation and\nempirical validation provide strong evidence of its effectiveness and potential for widespread impact.\nWe believe this work will stimulate further research into the development of more efficient and robust\ncausal inference techniques, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable causal inferences in\ndiverse settings.",
  "related_work": "Our work builds upon a rich body of literature on causal inference with latent confounders. Traditional\napproaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1,\n2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These\nassumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. For\ninstance, methods based on instrumental variables [4] require the identification of a variable that\naffects the treatment but not the outcome directly, a condition that is often hard to satisfy. Similarly,\ntechniques relying on conditional independence assumptions [5] may be sensitive to violations of\nthese assumptions, leading to biased estimates. Our approach offers a significant advantage by\nrelaxing these stringent requirements.\n\nSeveral recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6,\n7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in\nmany real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to\nthe quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable,\nmaking it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments\nto extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our\napproach from existing methods.\n\nThe use of cross-moments in causal inference has been explored in various contexts [8, 9]. However,\nthese methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data\ngenerating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range\nof scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and\nvalidity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical\nanalysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches.\n\nOur algorithm also addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data, a common issue in modern\ncausal inference problems. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity\nassociated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Our\nmethod\u2019s efficiency and scalability make it particularly well-suited for such scenarios. This scalability\nis achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally\nefficient algorithms. This aspect of our work contributes to the growing need for scalable causal\ninference techniques.\n\n2\n\n\fFinally, our work contributes to the broader goal of developing more robust and reliable causal\ninference methods. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con-\nfounders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method\u2019s\nability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and\nscalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly\nsoftware implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact.",
  "methodology": "Our proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate\ncausal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing\nmethods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a\nmore practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the\ncross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from\nthe indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing\nthe relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to\neffectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to\nmodel misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a\nwide range of real-world applications. The algorithm\u2019s efficiency stems from its ability to directly\nutilize cross-moments, avoiding computationally expensive iterative procedures often found in other\nmethods. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets. Furthermore,\nthe algorithm\u2019s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on\nits performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are\nconsistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework\ndistinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm\u2019s robustness is further\nenhanced by its ability to handle noisy data and model misspecification, ensuring reliable results even\nin challenging scenarios. The algorithm\u2019s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of\nnoise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. The algorithm\u2019s\nmodular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to different settings.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in three main steps. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed\nvariables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the\ncomplex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal\neffect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are\nresistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy\nand robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers\nand noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves\nsolving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is\ncarefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal\neffect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting\nfor the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed\nto handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals\nfor the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the\nestimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are\nconstructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire\nprocess is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets.\n\nThe theoretical properties of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and\nvalidity. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild\nconditions. These theoretical guarantees provide a strong foundation for the application of the\nalgorithm in various settings. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true\ncausal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction\nof valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The\ntheoretical analysis also provides insights into the algorithm\u2019s robustness to model misspecification\nand the impact of noise. The theoretical results are supported by extensive simulations, demonstrating\nthe algorithm\u2019s superior performance compared to existing methods.

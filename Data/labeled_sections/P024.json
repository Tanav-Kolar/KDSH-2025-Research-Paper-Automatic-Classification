  "introduction": "This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of label-only backdoor attacks in machine\nlearning [1, 2]. In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training labels, without modifying the\ninput data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant backdoors into machine learning models. This\ncontrasts with traditional backdoor attacks that require manipulating the input data itself, making label-\nonly attacks a more subtle and potentially harder-to-detect threat. The ease with which an attacker can\nmanipulate labels, especially in crowd-sourced annotation settings, makes this a significant concern\nfor the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The potential for widespread impact\nnecessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This\nwork aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape.\n\nWe introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism\ndesigned to exploit vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically\nmanipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between\na specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution, or a specific pattern in the\nlabels themselves) and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model\u2019s\npredictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified\nby the model. The subtlety of the attack lies in its reliance on label manipulation alone, making it\ndifficult to detect using traditional methods focused on input data anomalies. The effectiveness of this\napproach hinges on the model\u2019s ability to learn spurious correlations between seemingly innocuous\nlabel patterns and the desired target output.\n\nThe effectiveness of FLIP is evaluated across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world\ndata collection challenges. We explore the impact of noisy labels, often encountered in crowd-\nsourced annotation settings, on the success rate of the attack. We investigate the robustness of FLIP\nagainst different defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, commonly\nemployed to enhance model robustness. Our experiments systematically vary key attack parameters,\nsuch as the number of poisoned labels and the strength of the trigger, to understand the trade-offs\ninvolved. This allows us to characterize the attack\u2019s effectiveness under different conditions and\nto identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for defense. The results provide valuable\ninsights into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models to this type of attack.\n\n.\n\n\fWe analyze the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA)\nunder different attack parameters. This analysis reveals a complex relationship between the number\nof poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger, and the overall performance of the model. We observe\nthat while increasing the number of poisoned labels generally improves PTA, it can also lead to a\nsignificant drop in CTA, indicating a trade-off between the effectiveness of the backdoor and the\nmodel\u2019s overall accuracy on clean data. This trade-off is crucial for attackers to consider when\ndesigning their attacks, as they need to balance the effectiveness of the backdoor with the risk of\ndetection. A careful analysis of this trade-off is essential for developing effective defense strategies.\n\nThe efficiency of FLIP is another key aspect of our study. We demonstrate that FLIP requires\nsignificantly fewer poisoned labels compared to traditional backdoor attacks that modify the input\ndata. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers who have limited access to the\ntraining data or who wish to remain undetected. The reduced computational overhead associated\nwith label manipulation also contributes to the efficiency of FLIP. This makes it a practical threat\neven in resource-constrained environments, highlighting the need for robust defenses that can operate\nefficiently as well. The low cost and high effectiveness of FLIP underscore the severity of the threat\nit poses.\n\nOur experiments further explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation [3].\nWe show that FLIP can effectively implant backdoors into student models trained using knowledge\ndistillation from a clean teacher model. This highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to\nlabel-only backdoor attacks, suggesting that the distillation process itself may inadvertently transfer\nthe backdoor from the teacher to the student model. This finding underscores the importance of\nsecuring the training data and processes at every stage of model development, emphasizing the need\nfor a holistic security approach. The implications for model training pipelines are significant and\nwarrant further investigation.\n\nThe implications of our findings are significant for the security and trustworthiness of machine\nlearning systems. The ease with which label-only backdoors can be implanted, even under realistic\nconditions, necessitates the development of new defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect\nand mitigate these types of attacks. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for\ndetecting subtle label manipulations and for designing training procedures that are less susceptible\nto label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. The development of such defenses is\ncrucial for mitigating the risks posed by FLIP and similar attacks.\n\nFinally, our work contributes to a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning\nmodels to adversarial attacks. The ability to implant backdoors using only label manipulation\nhighlights the importance of considering the entire training pipeline, including data collection,\nannotation, and model training, when assessing the security of machine learning systems. This\nholistic approach is crucial for developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems. Further research\nis needed to explore the potential for extending FLIP to other machine learning tasks and model\narchitectures, and to investigate the broader implications of label-only attacks on the trustworthiness\nof AI. The findings presented here represent a significant step towards a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of this emerging threat.",
  "related_work": "The field of adversarial attacks on machine learning models has seen significant growth in recent\nyears, with a focus on various attack strategies and defense mechanisms. Early work primarily\nconcentrated on input-based attacks, where adversaries manipulate the input data (e.g., images) to\ncause misclassification [4, 5]. These attacks often involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to\nthe input, making them difficult to detect. However, the reliance on input manipulation limits the\nattacker\u2019s reach, particularly in scenarios where direct access to the input data is restricted. Our\nwork explores a different paradigm, focusing on label-only attacks, which offer a more subtle and\npotentially harder-to-detect approach.\n\nLabel-only attacks represent a relatively nascent area of research, with fewer studies dedicated to\ntheir analysis and mitigation. Existing literature on data poisoning often focuses on manipulating\nthe training data itself, including both features and labels [6, 7]. However, these approaches often\nrequire a significant level of access to the training dataset, which may not always be feasible for an\n\n2\n\n\fattacker. In contrast, label-only attacks leverage the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation\nprocess, making them a more practical threat in real-world scenarios where data annotation is often\noutsourced or crowd-sourced. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to\ndetect and defend against.\n\nSeveral studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance [8, 9].\nWhile these studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, they provide a foundation\nfor understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. Our work builds upon this\nfoundation by investigating the impact of strategically injected label noise, specifically designed to\nimplant backdoors. The strategic manipulation of labels, as opposed to random noise, allows for a\nmore targeted and effective attack, highlighting the unique challenges posed by label-only backdoor\nattacks.\n\nThe concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipulation\n[10, 11]. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\nmisclassification. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying\nsolely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect. This distinction necessitates the development\nof novel defense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only\nattacks. The subtlety of label manipulation makes detection significantly more challenging compared\nto input-based attacks.\n\nKnowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for training efficient student models\nusing knowledge from larger teacher models [12, 13]. While knowledge distillation offers significant\nbenefits in terms of model compression and efficiency, our work highlights its vulnerability to label-\nonly backdoor attacks. The potential for backdoors to propagate from teacher to student models\nunderscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and\nthe distillation process itself. This finding emphasizes the need for a holistic security approach that\nconsiders all stages of model development.\n\nOur work contributes to the broader literature on adversarial machine learning by exploring a novel\nattack vector\u2014label-only backdoors. This expands the understanding of vulnerabilities in machine\nlearning systems beyond traditional input-based attacks. The findings presented in this paper highlight\nthe need for a more comprehensive approach to security, considering not only the input data but\nalso the entire training process, including data annotation and model training techniques. Future\nresearch should focus on developing robust defenses against label-only attacks, considering the\nunique challenges they pose. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods.\n\n3 Background\n\nLabel-only backdoor attacks represent a significant and emerging threat to the security and trustwor-\nthiness of machine learning models. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that involve manipulating\ninput data, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the training process by corrupting only the training\nlabels. This subtle manipulation can lead to the implantation of backdoors that are difficult to detect\nusing conventional methods. The ease with which labels can be altered, particularly in crowd-sourced\nannotation settings, makes this a particularly concerning vulnerability. The potential for widespread\nimpact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks.\nThis research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape and to\ninform the development of robust countermeasures. The focus is on understanding the mechanisms by\nwhich these attacks operate, their effectiveness under various conditions, and the trade-offs involved\nin their implementation.\n\nThe existing literature on data poisoning primarily focuses on manipulating both features and labels\nwithin the training dataset. However, these approaches often require significant access to the training\ndata, which may not always be feasible for an attacker. Label-only attacks offer a more practical\nalternative, leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation process. The subtlety of\nthese attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against, as they do not involve\nreadily apparent modifications to the input data itself. This necessitates the development of novel\ndefense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks.\nThe challenge lies in identifying subtle patterns in the label distribution that might indicate malicious\nmanipulation.\n\n3\n\n\fSeveral studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance. These\nstudies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, providing a foundation for understanding\nhow label inconsistencies can affect model learning. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ\nsignificantly in that the label noise is strategically injected, rather than being random. This strategic\nmanipulation allows for a more targeted and effective attack, resulting in the implantation of a\nbackdoor that triggers specific misclassifications. The ability to control the nature and location of\nthe label noise is crucial to the success of the attack. Understanding the interplay between the level\nof noise, the strategic placement of poisoned labels, and the resulting model behavior is key to\ndeveloping effective defenses.\n\nThe concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipu-\nlation. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\nmisclassification when a particular trigger is present in the input. However, label-only backdoor\nattacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the\nsame effect. This distinction necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically\ntailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation\nmakes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks, requiring more\nsophisticated methods for identifying anomalous patterns in the label distribution.\n\nKnowledge distillation is a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge\nfrom larger teacher models. While knowledge distillation offers significant benefits in terms of model\ncompression and efficiency, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities to label-only backdoor attacks.\nIf the teacher model is compromised, the backdoor can propagate to the student model during the\ndistillation process. This highlights the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including\nthe teacher model and the distillation process itself. A holistic security approach is crucial to mitigate\nthe risks associated with knowledge distillation in the presence of label-only backdoor attacks. The\npotential for cascading vulnerabilities underscores the need for robust security measures at every\nstage of model development.\n\nThe development of robust defenses against label-only backdoor attacks is a critical area of future\nresearch. These defenses should focus on detecting subtle label manipulations and designing training\nprocedures that are less susceptible to these attacks. Techniques that leverage label consistency\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods are promising avenues for exploration.\nThe challenge lies in developing methods that can effectively identify malicious label manipulations\nwithout significantly impacting the performance of the model on clean data. A balance must be struck\nbetween security and accuracy, ensuring that the defenses do not unduly compromise the model\u2019s\nutility. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by label-only\nbackdoor attacks and ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning systems.",
  "methodology": "This section details the methodology employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of label-\nonly backdoor attacks using the FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison) mechanism. Our approach\ninvolves a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world\ndata collection challenges and model training paradigms. The core of our methodology centers\naround strategically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a\nspecific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation\nis designed to force the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without\nmodifying the input data itself.\n\nThe effectiveness of FLIP is assessed across multiple datasets and model architectures. We systemat-\nically vary key attack parameters, including the percentage of poisoned labels, the strength of the\ntrigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern), and the type of trigger used.\nThe choice of datasets and models ensures generalizability and robustness of our findings. We employ\nstandard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA),\nto quantify the impact of the attack. CTA measures the model\u2019s accuracy on clean, unpoisoned data,\nwhile PTA measures the model\u2019s accuracy on data associated with the trigger. The trade-off between\nCTA and PTA is a crucial aspect of our analysis, providing insights into the attack\u2019s effectiveness\nversus its detectability.\n\n4\n\n\fTo simulate real-world scenarios, we introduce label noise into the training data. This noise is inde-\npendent of the strategically injected poisoned labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered\nin crowd-sourced annotation settings. By varying the level of label noise, we assess the robustness of\nFLIP against noisy labels. We hypothesize that even with a significant level of random label noise,\nFLIP will remain effective due to the strategic nature of the poisoned labels. This analysis provides\nvaluable insights into the attack\u2019s resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions.\n\nFurthermore, we investigate the robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms. Specifi-\ncally, we evaluate the attack\u2019s effectiveness against data augmentation techniques and adversarial\ntraining. Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the training dataset by applying various\ntransformations to the existing data. Adversarial training aims to improve model robustness by\ntraining the model on adversarial examples, which are designed to fool the model. By testing FLIP\nagainst these defenses, we assess its resilience to commonly employed security measures. This\nanalysis helps to identify potential weaknesses in existing defenses and inform the development of\nmore robust countermeasures.\n\nThe efficiency of FLIP is evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for\nsuccessful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. We expect\nFLIP to require significantly fewer poisoned labels, making it a more efficient and stealthy attack.\nThis efficiency is a key advantage of label-only attacks, as it reduces the attacker\u2019s effort and risk of\ndetection. The computational overhead associated with label manipulation is also significantly lower\nthan that of input data modification, further enhancing the practicality of FLIP.\n\nFinally, we explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We train a\nstudent model using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model, where the teacher model\u2019s\ntraining data has been subjected to a FLIP attack. We investigate whether the backdoor is transferred\nfrom the teacher to the student model during the distillation process. This analysis highlights the\npotential for cascading vulnerabilities in model training pipelines and underscores the importance of\nsecuring the training data and processes at every stage of model development. The results provide\ninsights into the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks.\n\nThe experimental setup involves a rigorous comparison across various datasets, model architectures,\nand attack parameters. The results are statistically analyzed to ensure the reliability and significance\nof our findings. The comprehensive nature of our methodology allows for a thorough evaluation of\nFLIP\u2019s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness, providing valuable insights into the challenges posed\nby label-only backdoor attacks. This detailed analysis informs the development of more effective\ndefense mechanisms and contributes to a broader understanding of the security vulnerabilities in\nmachine learning systems.\n\nOur methodology emphasizes a holistic approach, considering various aspects of the attack, including\nits effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and applicability in different contexts. This comprehensive\nevaluation provides a robust assessment of the threat posed by FLIP and informs the development of\neffective countermeasures. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities of\nmachine learning systems to label-only backdoor attacks and highlight the need for a more holistic\napproach to security in the design and deployment of machine learning models.",

Our primary evaluation metrics were Clean Test\nAccuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), measuring the model\u2019s performance on clean and\npoisoned data, respectively.

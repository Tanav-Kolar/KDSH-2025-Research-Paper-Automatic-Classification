  "abstract": "To enhance the accuracy and scalability of decision tree algorithms, we introduce a\ngeneralization called Top-k. This approach considers the top k features as potential\nsplits at each step, rather than the single best feature, offering a trade-off between\nthe simplicity of greedy algorithms and the accuracy of optimal decision trees. The\ncore idea is to explore a wider range of potential splits at each node, mitigating\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal choices inherent in traditional greedy\napproaches. This exploration is controlled by the parameter k, allowing for a\nflexible balance between computational cost and predictive performance. Larger\nvalues of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but\nincreasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed.",
  "introduction": "Decision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms renowned for their inter-\npretability and ease of implementation. However, traditional greedy algorithms like ID3, C4.5, and\nCART [1, 2] suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with\nhigh-dimensional datasets. These algorithms typically select the single best feature for splitting at\neach node, a process that can be susceptible to noise and prone to suboptimal choices early in the\ntree construction. This inherent greediness can lead to shallow trees with limited predictive power,\nespecially when relevant features are masked by irrelevant ones. The computational cost, while\ngenerally manageable for smaller datasets, can also become prohibitive for larger-scale applications.\n\nTo address these limitations, we introduce Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms\nthat offers a compelling balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability.\nInstead of\nselecting only the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split\ncandidates. This approach allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter k provides a flexible control\nmechanism: larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy\nbut increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of\nsome accuracy. This trade-off allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and\ncomputational resources.\n\nThe core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection.\nBy considering multiple top features, Top-k reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy\nfeature early in the tree construction. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where\nthe presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional\ngreedy algorithms. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k leads to deeper and more accurate\ntrees, resulting in improved predictive performance.\n\nOur theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derive a lower\nbound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound\nis tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms [3]. This theoretical improvement\nis complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which showcases the consistent superiority\nof Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement is particularly pronounced in\nhigh-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident.\n\n.\n\n\fThe practical implementation of Top-k is surprisingly efficient. We leverage optimized data structures\nand algorithms to manage the top k feature candidates, ensuring that the computational overhead\nremains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe computational cost scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a\npractical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications.\n\nBeyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision\ntrees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a\nlayer of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes\nTop-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.\nFurthermore, we explore the integration of Top-k into ensemble methods like random forests and\ngradient boosting machines, demonstrating its versatility and potential for further performance\nenhancements [4]. We also investigate the impact of different feature selection metrics on Top-k\u2019s\nperformance, providing insights into its adaptability to various datasets and problem domains. Finally,\nwe discuss the limitations of Top-k and outline promising avenues for future research.",
  "related_work": "Decision trees have been a cornerstone of machine learning for decades, with algorithms like ID3 ?,\nC4.5 ?, and CART ? forming the foundation of many applications. These algorithms, however, rely\non greedy approaches that select the single best feature at each node, potentially leading to suboptimal\nsplits and limited accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The inherent limitations of greedy\nfeature selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies. One line of research\nfocuses on improving the feature selection process itself, exploring more sophisticated metrics beyond\ninformation gain and Gini impurity ?. Other approaches have investigated ensemble methods, such as\nrandom forests ? and gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to enhance\npredictive performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees\nbut can introduce increased computational complexity.\n\nOur work builds upon this rich body of research by proposing a novel generalization of decision\ntree algorithms that directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection. Unlike traditional\nmethods that focus solely on the single best feature, Top-k explores the top k features at each\nnode, offering a controlled trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. This approach is\ndistinct from other ensemble methods in that it modifies the base learner itself, rather than relying\non combining multiple independently trained trees. The parameter k provides a flexible mechanism\nto adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their\nspecific needs and computational resources. This flexibility is a key advantage over existing methods\nthat often lack such a tunable parameter for controlling the complexity of the search space.\n\nSeveral studies have explored alternative splitting criteria for decision trees, aiming to improve\naccuracy and robustness. For instance, research has investigated the use of different impurity\nmeasures, such as entropy and variance, and their impact on tree performance ?. However, these\nstudies primarily focus on improving the single-feature selection process, without addressing the\nfundamental limitation of greedy approaches. Top-k, in contrast, directly tackles this limitation\nby considering multiple features at each split, offering a more robust and accurate approach. This\nfundamental difference distinguishes Top-k from previous work that primarily focuses on refining the\nfeature selection metric or the tree structure itself.\n\nThe concept of considering multiple features during splitting has been explored in other contexts,\nsuch as oblique decision trees ?, which use linear combinations of features for splitting. However,\nthese methods often introduce increased computational complexity and can be less interpretable than\ntraditional decision trees. Top-k, on the other hand, maintains the inherent interpretability of decision\ntrees while offering a more efficient and scalable approach to multi-feature splitting. The simplicity\nand efficiency of Top-k are crucial advantages, making it a practical alternative to more complex\nmethods.\n\nFurthermore, our work contributes to the broader field of high-dimensional data analysis. In high-\ndimensional settings, the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the\nperformance of traditional greedy algorithms. Top-k\u2019s ability to explore multiple features helps\nmitigate this issue, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in such scenarios. This is particularly\nrelevant in modern applications where datasets often contain thousands or even millions of features.\n\n2\n\n\fThe scalability of Top-k makes it a suitable choice for these large-scale problems, where traditional\nmethods may struggle.\n\nFinally, our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k, deriving a\nlower bound on the generalization error that is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algo-\nrithms. This theoretical contribution complements our empirical findings, providing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of Top-k\u2019s performance and its advantages over existing methods. The combination of\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens the overall contribution of our work. Future\nresearch could explore adaptive strategies for choosing the optimal value of k during training, further\nenhancing the performance and adaptability of Top-k.\n\n3 Background\n\nDecision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms widely used due to their\ninterpretability and relative simplicity. Traditional algorithms such as ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?\nconstruct trees by recursively partitioning the data based on a greedy selection of the single best\nfeature at each node. This greedy approach, while computationally efficient, suffers from limitations\nin accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or datasets\nwith noisy features. The selection of a single best feature at each node can lead to suboptimal splits\nearly in the tree construction process, resulting in shallow trees with limited predictive power. This\nis especially problematic when relevant features are masked by numerous irrelevant or noisy ones.\nFurthermore, the computational cost of these algorithms can become prohibitive for large datasets,\nhindering their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The inherent limitations of greedy feature\nselection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies for building more accurate and\nefficient decision trees.\n\nOne area of active research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself. Researchers\nhave explored more sophisticated metrics beyond the commonly used information gain and Gini\nimpurity ?, aiming to identify more informative features for splitting. However, even with improved\nfeature selection metrics, the fundamental limitation of selecting only a single feature at each node\nremains. Another line of research has focused on ensemble methods, such as random forests ?\nand gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive\nperformance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can\nintroduce increased computational complexity and reduce interpretability. The challenge lies in\nfinding a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability.\n\nThe limitations of traditional decision tree algorithms stem from their inherent greediness. The single-\nbest-feature selection strategy can lead to premature commitment to suboptimal splits, hindering the\nability of the algorithm to discover more complex relationships within the data. This is particularly\nevident in high-dimensional datasets where the presence of many irrelevant features can significantly\nimpact the performance of greedy algorithms. The noise and irrelevant information can easily mislead\nthe algorithm, leading to inaccurate and unreliable predictions. The problem is exacerbated by the\nfact that the greedy approach does not allow for backtracking or revisiting previous decisions, making\nit susceptible to errors made early in the tree construction process. This inherent limitation motivates\nthe need for more robust and less greedy approaches to decision tree construction.\n\nOur proposed Top-k algorithm directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection by\nconsidering multiple top features at each node. Instead of selecting only the single best feature, Top-k\nexplores the top k features as potential split candidates. This allows for a more thorough exploration\nof the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter\nk provides a flexible control mechanism, allowing for a trade-off between computational cost and\naccuracy. Larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but\nincreasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of some\naccuracy. This flexibility allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and\ncomputational resources.\n\nThe core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection\nby considering multiple features at each split. This approach reduces the probability of selecting an\nirrelevant or noisy feature early in the tree construction process, leading to deeper and more accurate\ntrees. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional\nsettings where the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance\n\n3\n\n\fof traditional greedy algorithms. By considering multiple features, Top-k reduces the impact of\nnoise and irrelevant information, resulting in improved robustness and predictive performance. The\nalgorithm\u2019s efficiency is further enhanced by the use of optimized data structures and algorithms for\nmanaging the top k feature candidates.\n\nThe theoretical analysis of Top-k provides a rigorous foundation for its advantages over traditional\ngreedy algorithms. We derive a lower bound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating\nthat under certain conditions, this bound is tighter than those achievable by traditional methods\n?. This theoretical improvement is complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which\nshowcases the consistent superiority of Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement\nis particularly pronounced in high-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple\nfeatures become most evident. The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical validation\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of Top-k\u2019s performance and its advantages over existing\nmethods. Furthermore, the inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k, making it\na valuable tool for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.",
  "methodology": "The Top-k algorithm builds upon the fundamental principles of traditional decision tree algorithms\nbut introduces a key modification to the feature selection process. Instead of greedily selecting the\nsingle best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split candidates. This\napproach significantly alters the search space explored during tree construction, leading to a more\nrobust and less prone-to-error process. The algorithm proceeds recursively, starting with the root\nnode and the entire dataset. At each node, the top k features are identified based on a chosen splitting\ncriterion (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity). For each of these top k features, the optimal split\npoint is determined, and the resulting information gain or impurity reduction is calculated. The\nfeature and split point yielding the maximum improvement are then selected to partition the data into\nchild nodes. This process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met\n(e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf).\n\nThe selection of the top k features is a crucial step in the Top-k algorithm. We employ efficient sorting\nalgorithms to identify the top k features based on the chosen splitting criterion. The computational\ncomplexity of this step is primarily determined by the sorting algorithm used and the number of\nfeatures in the dataset. To maintain efficiency, we leverage optimized data structures and algorithms,\nensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values\nof k. We experimented with various sorting algorithms, including quicksort and mergesort, and\nfound that quicksort generally provided the best performance in our experiments. The choice of\nsorting algorithm can be further optimized based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and\nthe available computational resources. Furthermore, we explored the use of approximate sorting\nalgorithms to further reduce the computational cost, particularly for very large datasets.\n\nThe choice of splitting criterion significantly influences the performance of the Top-k algorithm. We\ninvestigated the use of several common splitting criteria, including information gain, Gini impurity,\nand variance reduction. Each criterion offers a different trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. Information gain, for instance, is computationally more expensive than Gini impurity but often\nleads to more accurate trees. Variance reduction, on the other hand, is particularly suitable for\nregression tasks. Our experiments compared the performance of Top-k using these different criteria\nacross a range of benchmark datasets. The results indicated that the optimal choice of splitting\ncriterion depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, highlighting the adaptability of Top-k\nto various scenarios. We also explored the possibility of using adaptive splitting criteria, which\ndynamically adjust the criterion based on the characteristics of the data at each node.\n\nThe parameter k plays a crucial role in controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. Larger values of k lead to a more exhaustive search of the feature space, potentially improv-\ning accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. The optimal value of k depends on the specific\ndataset and the available computational resources. In our experiments, we systematically varied the\nvalue of k to investigate its impact on both accuracy and computational cost. We observed that the\nimprovement in accuracy plateaus beyond a certain value of k, suggesting that there is a point of\ndiminishing returns. This observation provides valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing an\n\n4\n\n\fappropriate value of k for their specific applications. Furthermore, we explored adaptive strategies\nfor choosing the value of k during training, dynamically adjusting it based on the characteristics of\nthe data at each node.\n\nThe implementation of Top-k is surprisingly straightforward. We developed a Python implementation\nof the algorithm, leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms from the Scikit-learn library.\nThe code is well-documented and readily available for reproducibility. The implementation includes\noptions for choosing different splitting criteria, setting the value of k, and specifying various stopping\ncriteria. The modular design of the code allows for easy extension and customization. The computa-\ntional cost of the algorithm scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making it\na practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications. We conducted\nextensive experiments to evaluate the scalability of the algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle\nlarge datasets efficiently.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the performance of Top-k on a range of benchmark datasets, comparing its\naccuracy and computational cost to traditional decision tree algorithms such as ID3, C4.5, and\nCART ???. The results consistently demonstrated the superiority of Top-k in terms of accuracy,\nparticularly in high-dimensional datasets. The computational cost of Top-k, while higher than\ntraditional greedy algorithms, remained manageable, especially when considering the significant\nimprovement in accuracy. The parameter k provided a flexible mechanism to control this trade-off,\nallowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources. The\nresults of our experiments are presented in detail in the Results section.",
  "experiments": "This section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the performance of\nthe Top-k algorithm. We compared Top-k against three widely used decision tree algorithms:\nID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?. Our experiments were conducted on a diverse range of benchmark\ndatasets, encompassing both low-dimensional and high-dimensional instances, to thoroughly assess\nthe algorithm\u2019s robustness and scalability. The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values\nand outliers, ensuring a fair comparison across all algorithms. We employed standard data splitting\ntechniques, reserving a portion of each dataset for testing and using the remaining data for training.\nPerformance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm\u2019s predictive capabilities. The choice of\nthese metrics was driven by the need to capture various aspects of the algorithm\u2019s performance,\nincluding its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances. Furthermore, we analyzed\nthe computational cost of each algorithm, measuring the training time and memory usage to assess\ntheir scalability. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions about the\nrelative strengths and weaknesses of Top-k compared to traditional decision tree algorithms.\n\nThe parameter k in the Top-k algorithm plays a crucial role in balancing accuracy and computational\ncost. To investigate this trade-off, we conducted experiments with varying values of k, ranging\nfrom 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to a significantly larger value determined by the\ndimensionality of the dataset. For each value of k, we trained and evaluated the Top-k algorithm on\neach benchmark dataset, recording both the performance metrics and the computational cost. This\nsystematic variation of k allowed us to observe the impact of increased exploration on both accuracy\nand efficiency. We observed that increasing k generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-\ndimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature can be highly susceptible to noise\nand irrelevant information.

Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model
Compression

Abstract

Real-world business applications require a trade-off between language model
performance and size. We propose a new method for model compression that relies
on vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and
downstream tasks. Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be effectively
used in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a significant
reduction in model size and inference time while marginally compromising on
performance.

Introduction

In the last few years, many NLP applications have been relying more and more on large pre-trained
Language Models (LM). Because larger LMs, on average, exhibit higher accuracy, a common trend
has been to increase the model’s size. Some LMs like GPT-3 and BLOOM have reached hundreds
of billion parameters. However, these models’ superior performance comes at the cost of a steep
increase in computational footprint, both for development and for inference, ultimately hampering
their adoption in real-world business use-cases. Besides models that only a few hi-tech giants can
afford, like GPT-3, even smaller LMs with hundreds of million parameters could be too expensive
or infeasible for certain products. For one thing, despite being tremendously cheaper than their
bigger cousins, fine-tuning, deploying and maintaining large numbers of such models (one for each
downstream task) soon becomes too expensive. Furthermore, latency and/or hardware requirements
may limit their applicability to specific use-cases. For all these reasons, significant efforts - in both
academic and industry-driven research - are oriented towards the designing of solutions to drastically
reduce the costs of LMs.

Recently, several attempts have been made to make these models smaller, faster and cheaper, while
retaining most of their original performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a teacher-student
framework, whereby the teacher consists of a pre-trained large model and the student of a smaller
one. The teacher-student framework requires that both the teacher and the student estimate the same
probability distribution. While the outcome is a smaller model, yet, this procedure constrains the
student to operate with the same vocabulary as the teacher in the context of Language Modeling.

In this work, we explore a method for further reducing an LM’s size by compressing its vocabulary
through the training of a tokenizer in the downstream task domain. The tokenizer is a crucial part
of modern LMs. In particular, moving from word to subword- level, the tokenization solves two
problems: vocabulary explosion and unknown words. Moreover, the capability to tokenize text
effectively in any domain is key for the massive adoption of pre-trained general-purpose LMs fine-
tuned on downstream tasks. Indeed, tokenizers are still able to process out-of-distribution texts at the
cost of producing frequent word splits into multiple tokens.

However, the language varies significantly in vertical domains or, more generally, in different topics.
Hence, ad-hoc tokenizers, trained on the domain statistics, may perform a more efficient tokenization,
reducing on average the length of the tokenized sequences. This is important since compact and
meaningful inputs could reduce computational costs, while improving performance. Indeed, memory
and time complexity of attention layers grows quadratically with respect to the sequence length.

Furthermore, a vertical tokenizer may require a smaller vocabulary, which also affects the size of the
embedding matrix, hence further reducing the model’s size.

Following this intuition, we propose a Vocabulary Transfer (VT) technique to adapt LMs to in-domain,
smaller tokenizers, in order to further compress and accelerate them. This technique is complementary
to the aforementioned model compression methods and independent of the type of tokenizer. As a
matter of fact, we apply it in combination with KD.

Our experiments show that VT achieves an inference speed-up between x1.07 and x1.40, depending
on the downstream task, with a limited performance drop, and that a combination of VT with KD
yields an overall reduction up to x2.76.

The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related works in Section 2, we present the
methodology in Section 3, we then outline the experiments in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in
Section 5.

2 Related Work

The goal of Model Compression is to shrink and optimize neural architectures, while retaining most
of their initial performance. Research on LM compression has been carried out following a variety of
approaches like quantization, pruning knowledge distillation, and combinations thereof.

A most popular distillation approach in NLP was proposed by Sanh et al. (2019). The obtained
model, called DistilBERT, is a smaller version of BERT, with the same architecture but half the layers,
trained to imitate the full output distribution of the teacher (a pre-trained BERT model). DistilBERT
has a 40

Little focus has been devoted thus far to the role of tokenization in the context of model compression.
Even in domain adaptation, the vocabulary was kept the same. Both the versatility of the subword-
level tokenization, and the constraints imposed by the teacher- student framework (same output
distribution), discouraged such investigations. Recently, Samenko et al. (2021) presented an approach
for transferring the vocabulary of an LM into a new vocabulary learned from new domain, with the
purpose of boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to study VT in the scope of model compression.

3 Vocabulary Transfer

Let us consider a LM, trained on a general-purpose domain Dgen and associated with a vocabulary
Vgen. Such a vocabulary is used by the LM’s tokenizer in order to produce an encoding of the input
string via an embedding matrix Egen defined on Vgen. More specifically, a tokenizer is a function
that maps a textual string into a sequence of symbols of a given vocabulary V . Let T be a tokenizer
associated with a vocabulary V and a string s, we have T : s → (t1, . . . , tn), ti ∈ V, ∀i = 1, . . . , n.
Hence, the vocabulary of the tokenizer determines how words in a text are split, whether as words,
sub-words, or even characters. These symbols, which define the LM’s vocabulary, are statistically
determined by training the tokenizer to learn the distribution of a dataset.

Now, let us consider a vertical domain Din, also referred as in-domain. For the reasons discussed
earlier, a vocabulary Vin specialized on Din itself better fits the language distribution than Vgen.
Unfortunately, with a new vocabulary, embedding representations associated with the tokens of Vgen
would be lost. Thus, VT aims to initialize Vin by re-using most of the information learned from the
LM pre-trained on Dgen. Once the new tokenizer Tin has been trained on the in-domain dataset Din
using a given vocabulary size, Tin will be different from the LM’s tokenizer Tgen. However, the two
tokenizers’ vocabularies Vgen and Vin may still have a large portion of their symbols in common.
Our objective is to transfer most of the information from Vgen into Vin. To this end, we first define a
mapping between each symbol in Vin and a set of symbols in Vgen. Then, we define an assignment
criterion, based on the mapping, to obtain the embeddings for the tokens of Tin.

One such criterion, called Vocabulary Initialization with Partial Inheritance (VIPI), was defined by
Samenko et al. (2021). Whenever a token is in Vin but not in Vgen, VIPI calculates all the partitions
of the new token with tokens from Vgen, then takes the minimal partitions and finally averages them
to obtain an embedding for the new token. Differently, we define a simplified implementation of

2

VIPI called FVT for Fast Vocabulary Transfer. Instead of calculating all tokenizations, FVT uses a
straightforward assignment mechanism, whereby each token ti ∈ Vin is partitioned using Tgen. If ti
belongs to both vocabularies, ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen, then Tgen(ti) = ti and the in-domain LM embedding.

If instead ti ∈ Vin \ Vgen, then the in-domain embedding is the average of the embeddings associated
with the tokens produced by Tgen:

Ein(ti) = Egen(ti).

(1)

Ein(t :) =

1
|Tgen(ti)|

(cid:88)

Egen(tj)

tj ∈Tgen(ti)

(2)

Please notice that Equation (2) is a generalization of Equation (1). Indeed, in case ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen,
Equation (2) falls back to Equation (1).

Once embeddings are initialized with FVT, we adjust the model’s weights by training it with MLM
on the in-domain data before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. MLM eases adaptation and has
already been found to be beneficial in (Samenko et al., 2021). We observed this trend as well during
preliminary experiments, therefore we kept such a tuning stage in all our experiments.

As a baseline model, we also implement a method called Partial Vocabulary Transfer (PVT), whereby
only the tokens belonging to both vocabularies ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen are initialized with pre-trained
embeddings, while unseen new tokens are randomly initialized.

3.1 Distillation

VT can be combined with other model compression methods like quantization, pruning and KD. For
some of the methods, the combination is trivial, since they have no impact on the vocabulary. KD,
however, requires the vocabularies of the student and teacher to be aligned. Hence, its integration
with VT is non-trivial. Accordingly, we set up a KD procedure with VT, in order to determine the
effects of applying both VT and KD to an LM.

Our distillation consists of two steps. In the first step, we replicate the distillation process used in
(Sanh et al., 2019) for DistilBERT, in which the number of layers of the encoder is halved and a
triple loss-function is applied: a distillation loss, a MLM loss, and a cosine embedding loss. However,
unlike the original setup, we do not remove the token-type embeddings and pooler. after distilling the
student on Dgen, we further distil the student using Din. However, instead of adapting the teacher
before the second distillation, we simply distil the student a second time on the in-domain dataset.
Finally, we apply VT using either FVT or PVT and fine-tune the student model on the in-domain
datasets.

Our choice of applying VT after KD is based on findings by Kim and Hassan (2020), that different
input embedding spaces will produce different output embedding spaces. This difference in spaces is
not conducive to knowledge transfer during distillation. Hence, if VT were to be applied first to the
student, its input embedding space would differ greatly from that of the pre-trained teacher during
distillation.

4 Experiments

In the experiments we measure the impact of FVT on three main KPIs: quality (F1 score), size of the
models and speedup in inference.

4.1 Experimental Setup

We consider for all our experiments the pre-trained cased version of BERTbase as our pre-trained
language model. Its tokenizer is composed of 28996 wordpieces. We then define four vocabulary
sizes for retraining our tokenizers. Specifically, we take the original vocabulary size and define it
as a vocabulary size of 100 percent. We subsequently reduce this size to 75percent, 50percent, and
25percent, From now on, we will refer to such tokenizers as T100, T75, T50, T25 respectively, while
the original vocabulary will be called Tgen.

3

Models are fine-tuned for 10 epochs with early stopping on the downstream task. We set the initial
learning rate to 3 × 10−5 and batch size to 64 for each task. The sequence length is set to 64 for ADE
and CoNLL03 and 128 for LEDGAR. Each configuration is repeated 3 times with different random
initializations. MLM is performed for one epoch.

4.2 Datasets

To best assess the effectiveness of VT, we apply it on three different tasks from three heterogeneous
linguistic domains: medical (ADE), legal (LEDGAR) and news (CoNLL03). Table 4 reports the
dataset statistics.

ADE. The Adverse Drug Events (ADE) corpus is a binary sentence

classification dataset in the medical domain. This domain is particularly suitable for investigating the
benefits of VT, since documents are characterized by the presence of frequent technical terms, such
as drug and disease names, that are usually rare in common language. Domain-specific words are
usually split into multiple tokens, yielding longer sequences and breaking the semantics of a word
into multiple pieces. An example is shown in Figure 2.

LEDGAR. LEDGAR is a document classification corpus of legal provisions in contracts from
the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The dataset is annotated with 100 different
mutually-exclusive labels. It is also part of LexGLUE, a benchmark for legal language understanding.

CoNLL03. CoNLL03 is a popular Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmark. It is made of news
stories from the Reuters corpus. We chose this corpus because, differently from ADE and LEDGAR,
the news domain typically uses a more standard language, hence we expect its distribution to differ
less from the one captured by a general-purpose tokenizers in the web. Statistics in Table 1 confirms
this hypothesis. We can observe that the sequence compression gain obtained with domain- specific
tokenizers is less significant with respect to LEDGAR and ADE.

4.3 Results

We report an extensive evaluation of FVT on different setups and perspectives.

In-domain Tokenization. By retraining the tokenizer on the in-domain dataset, the average number of
tokens per sequence decreases since the learned distribution reduces the number of word splits, as
shown in Table 1. In the medical domain, which is particularly specialized, we notice a remarkable

Vocabulary Transfer. From the results shown in Tables 2 and 3, we note a few interesting findings.
First, FVT vectors initialization method consistently outperforms the baseline PVT, which confirms
the positive contribution of Equation 2. Second, transferring vocabulary with FVT causes limited
drops in performance, especially in LEDGAR (the largest one), where F1 slightly increases despite a

Vocabulary Transfer and Distillation. The results summarized in Table 3 clearly indicate that KD
is complementary to VT: there is no harm in applying them together, in terms of performance on
the downstream task. Crucially, this guarantees a full exploitation of FVT in the scope of language
model compression.

Compression and Efficiency. After showcasing that VT has limited impact on performance, we
analyze and discuss its effects on efficiency and model compression. Table 5 reports the relative
F1 drop on the downstream task with respect to the original LM (˘2206F1), the relative reduction in
model size (˘2206Size) and the speedup gained by FVT alone and by FVT combined with KD for
varying vocabulary sizes. Either way, FVT achieves a remarkable 15

Furthermore, the reduced input length enabled by in-domain tokenization brings a reduction in
inference time. The more a language is specialized, the higher is the speedup with in-domain
tokenizers. This is also confirmed by the experiments, where the major benefits are obtained on the
medical domain, with a x1.40 speedup. In CoNLL03 instead where language is much less specialized,
speedup reduces and even disappears with T25. Distillation further pushes compression and speedup
in any benchmark and setup, up to about 55

In summary, depending on the application needs, VT enables a strategic trade-off between compres-
sion rate, inference speed and accuracy.

5 Conclusion

The viability and success of industrial NLP applications often hinges on a delicate trade-off between
computational requirements, responsiveness and output quality. Hence, language model compression
methods are an active area of research whose practical ramifications are self-evident. One of the
factors that greatly contribute to a model’s inference speed and memory footprint is vocabulary size.
VT has been recently proposed for improving performance, but never so far in the scope of model

compression. In this work, we run an extensive experimental study on the application of a lightweight
method for VT, called FVT. An analysis conducted on various downstream tasks, application domains,
vocabulary sizes and on its possible combination with knowledge distillation indicates that FVT
enables a strategic trade-off between compression rate, inference speed and accuracy, especially, but
not only, in more specialized domains. Importantly, FVT appears to be orthogonal to other model
compression methods.

In the future, we plan to fully integrate Vocabulary Transfer within Knowledge Distillation during the
learning process in order to maximize the information transfer.
